# gamified-credit
A web-based platform that evaluates financial trustworthiness through AI-driven insights while incentivizing responsible financial behaviors.

Purpose:Traditional credit scoring systems often penalize financial missteps and fail to reward proactive financial responsibility. Our project reimagines this model by leveraging behavioral psychology—specifically the IKEA Effect and Self-Determination Theory—and gamification principles to create an engaging, positive, and empowering financial experience.

Technologies Used:
    Backend: Flask
    Frontend: Streamlit
    AI/ML: PyTorch
    Database: Firestore
    Authentication: Firebase Auth
